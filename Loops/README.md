<h1>Loops</h1>
<h2>while</h2>
<p>While the condition is truthy, the code from the loop body is executed.</p>
<p>A single execution of the loop body is called an iteration.</p>
<p>Any expression or variable can be a loop condition, not just comparisons: the condition is evaluated and converted to a boolean by <b>while</b></p>
<p>For instance, a shorter way to write <b>while (i != 0)</b> is <b>while (i)</b></p>
<h2>do while</h2>
<p>The condition check cn be moved below the loop body using the <b>do...while</b>. the loop will first execute the body, then ckech the condition, and, while it's truthy, execute it again and again. This firm of syntax should only be used when you want the body of the loop to execute at least once regardless of the condition being truthy. Usually, the other form is preferred.</p>
<h2>for</h2>
<p>This loop is more complex, but it's also the most commonly used loop.</p>
<p> begin	let i = 0	Executes once upon entering the loop.
    condition	i < 3	Checked before every loop iteration. If false, the loop stops.
    body	alert(i)	Runs again and again while the condition is truthy.
    step	i++	Executes after the body on each iteration.</p>
<p> Run begin
    → (if condition → run body and run step)</p>
<p>That is, <b>begin</b> executes once, and then it iterates: after each <b>condition</b> test, <b>body</b> and <b>step </b> are executed.</p>
<p>If we declared variable in the loop, this variable is called an 'inline variable declaration'. Such variables are visible only inside the loop.</p>
<h2>breaking the loop</h2>
<p>Normally, a pool exits when its condition becomes falsy. But we can force the exit at any time using the special break directive.</p>
<h2>Continue to the next iteration</h2>
<p>The continue directive is a “lighter version” of break. It doesn't stop the whole loop. Instead, it stops the current iteration and forces the loop to start a new one (if the condition allows). We can use it if we're done with the current iteration and would like to move on to the next one.</p>
<h2>Labels for break/continue</h2>
<p>Sometimes we need to break out from multiple nested loops at once.</p>
<p>A label is an identifier with a colon before a loop.</p>
