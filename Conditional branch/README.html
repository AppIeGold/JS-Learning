<p> instruction if evaluates the condition in brackets and, if result == true, to performs code block. If we want to execute more than one instruction, then we need to enclose the block of code in curly brackets, but better use curly brackets everytime.</p>

<h2>Block else</h2>
<p>The if instruction may contain an optional "else" block. It is executed when the condition is false.</p>

<h2>Multiple conditions</h2>
<p>Sometime need check multiple options conditions. For this used ,lock <b>else if</b></p>

<h2>Conditional operator ?</h2>
<p>Sometimes we need to define a variable depending on a condition. Conditional operator '?' or 'question mark' or 'ternary operator', since this operator, the only one of its kind, he has three arguments.   </p>
